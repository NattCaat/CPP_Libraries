# C++ LIBRARIES
Some custom libraries I am writing to practice coding. 

___
## Warning
I am writing those libraries to practice using C++. Therefore, they could contain
- A lot of bugs
- The potential to cause a stack overflow
- Memory leaks
- Very inefficient style of coding

I try my best, to avoid these, but I certainly cannot guarantuee for anything.
